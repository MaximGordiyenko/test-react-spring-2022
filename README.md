It's a test task for the React developer position at Dobby.

#### Requirements:
- Clone this repository
- To add search for description, category & user name
- To add logic for the create job form: get data from the form and send it to the backend
- To add some data validation, for example required, max length, etc

#### Will be a plus:
- Highlighting search matches in the list
- Adding empty/loading state to the screen
- Editing an item
- Implementing a select component for the category or selecting a provider for the task
- Implementing whatever you want to show your skills, habits in writing code, and thinking about UX
